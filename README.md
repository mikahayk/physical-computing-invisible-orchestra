# Invisible Orchestra installation

<b>Course</b>: Physical Computing <br>
<b>Skills</b>: HCI, Arduino, sensors, craftsmanship, design, LED, MIDI<br><br>

“Invisible Orchestra” is a touch-less musical instrument designed for performing artists to incorporate it with their own acts. We have 4 musical instruments, one for each tube: a flute, bass, violin, and organ. By sensing the performer gestures over the tubes via IR sensors, we transform that motion into music and at the same time control the LED blinks intensity. Output MIDI is being generated via additional processing from Ableton software. In a big scale the performer should be able to control not only the LEDs on tubes but the whole environment lightning and should have more than 4 tubes to play with. The installation is presented during the ITP Winter Show 2018 (NYU, Tisch School of Arts, 721 Broadway)<br><br>
